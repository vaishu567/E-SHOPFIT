I led the end-to-end design and development of a fully-featured ecommerce platform using the MERN technology stack. The application utilizes MongoDB for the database layer, Express.js for the backend API, React.js for the frontend user interface, and Node.js as the runtime environment.

Some of the key features implemented:

User Authentication - Registration and login with encrypted passwords and JSON web tokens.
Admin Dashboard - CRUD functionality to manage products, orders, users etc.
Cart Management - Add/remove products and quantity update. Persist cart items.
Payments - Integrated Stripe for processing credit card payments securely.
Order History - Users can view their order history and status.
Search/Filter - Intuitive searching and filtering of products.
Responsive Design - Mobile-friendly interface built using React Bootstrap.

The frontend leverages React Redux for state management across components along with React Router for routing. Axios is used for API calls to the Express backend which provides the REST endpoints and business logic.

The backend provides a robust REST API to power the frontend. MongoDB managed all data including products, user accounts, and orders.

Overall, the website provides a seamless ecommerce experience with optimized performance and scalability owing to the MERN stack.I led the end-to-end design and development of a fully-featured ecommerce platform using the MERN technology stack.
